XTextureExtractor extracts the textures for the HSI, ND, EICAS, and CDU displays, and renders them in separate windows that you can place anywhere within X-Plane, on external unused monitors, and on Android devices.

Most X-Plane 11 aircraft only allow you to view these displays within the virtual cockpit. These displays can also be quite small and hard to read. However, if you have a home cockpit set up with multiple monitors, it would be ideal to see each of these displays shown full screen and without having to move the view around to see it clearly. Some aircraft support a pop-up CDU, but rarely any of the other displays. There are external apps that can provide some of these displays, but they reimplement everything from scratch and will never be an exact match for your aircraft.

XTextureExtractor analyzes all the OpenGL textures and works out where these displays are rendered to. This same texture is then rendered into separate windows that you can move around and place wherever you want. They can be rendered as windows within X-Plane, or popped out and moved around within Windows itself. You can drag popped-out windows to external monitors and arrange them however you like.

X-Plane 11 doesn't natively support this functionality via the SDK, so the plugin uses OpenGL calls to try and guess the correct texture id. The coordinates of all the displays are hard coded for each supported aircraft. It has only been tested with an NVidia GTX 1080 and Windows 10, and the texture finding algorithm may not work on other video cards.

Supported aircraft are the standard X-Plane 737, Zibo 738, Flight Factor 757, and Flight Factor 767.

The plugin presents a number of buttons to click on:

- Pop-Out/Pop-In: switch between window within X-Plane or native OS window
- GL: shows the texture id and aircraft name. Click this to rescan for the texture again.
- <<: Continue scanning for texture, use this if the default scan doesn't work.
- Ld: Load the window placement config file.
- Sv: Save the window placement config file, digit after acknowledges that the save happened correctly.
- Clr: Delete the window placement config file.
- Dbg: Debug to the console and Log.txt texture information, and save the texture to disk.

You should extract the ZIP file and copy the Plugin-XTextureExtractor-x64-Release directory into your X-Plane 11\Resources\plugins directory.

This plugin is very experimental and may have bugs. I look forward to your feedback on this plugin, and hope you all find it useful.
